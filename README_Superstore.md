Superstore Sales

Retail dataset of a global superstore for 4 years. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis. Here are the steps that you can follow for univariate and bivariate data analysis on the SuperStore sales dataset:
Univariate Analysis:
1. Understand Dataset: Explore the structure of the dataset, including the number of rows and columns.
2. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, if any, and check for any anomalies in the data.
3. Data Types: Check the data types of each column. Ensure they are appropriate for the analysis.
4. Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic descriptive statistics for key numeric variables (e.g., sales, quantity).
5. Histograms: Create histograms to visualize the distribution of key numeric variables.
6. Time Series Plots: Plot time series graphs to understand the trends and patterns in sales over the 4-year period.
7. Seasonal Decomposition: Decompose time series data into components like trend, seasonality, and residuals for deeper insights.
8. Box Plots: Use box plots to identify outliers and understand the distribution of numeric variables.
9. Sales Distribution by Category: Visualize the distribution of sales across different categories using bar charts or pie charts.
10. Sales Variation Over Time: Plot line charts to observe how sales vary over different time periods (months, quarters, years).

Bivariate Analysis:
1. Correlation Analysis: Examine the correlation between sales and other relevant numeric variables.
2. Scatter Plots: Plot scatter plots to explore the relationship between sales and another numeric variable.

3. Pair Plots: Use pair plots for a quick overview of relationships between multiple numeric variables.
4. Category-wise Sales Trends: Analyze how sales trends differ across different categories using line charts.
5. Heatmaps: Create heatmaps to visualize the correlation matrix for better insights.
6. Sales by Region: Compare sales across different regions using bar charts or stacked bar charts.
7. Customer Segment Analysis: Explore sales trends for different customer segments using line charts or bar charts.
8. Sales vs. Quantity: Investigate the relationship between sales and quantity sold using scatter plots.
9. Customer Segment vs. Quantity: Compare the quantity sold across different customer segments using bar charts.
10. Discount Impact on Sales: Analyze the impact of discounts on sales using bar charts or line charts.
11. Shipping Mode vs. Sales: Explore the relationship between shipping modes and sales using categorical plots.
12. Product-wise Sales Analysis: Investigate how sales vary for different products or categories using bar charts or line charts.
13. Region-wise Product Sales: Compare product sales across different regions using grouped bar charts.
14. Document Findings: Summarize key findings from both univariate and bivariate analyses. Highlight any notable trends or insights.
By following these steps, you can gain a comprehensive understanding of the SuperStore sales dataset, uncovering patterns, trends, and relationships that can inform business decisions and support predictive modeling.
